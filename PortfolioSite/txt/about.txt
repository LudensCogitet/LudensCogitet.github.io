<p>I've done landscaping, carpentry, plumbing, and games journalism, but solving a problem or building a solution in code absorbs me like hardly anything else can.</p>

<p>I'm self-taught, familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript/Jquery, PHP, and Python, and always up for learning new frameworks and tackling new challanges.</p>

<p>Below you'll find descriptions of some of the things I've built, as well as links to live demonstrations of the apps and various GitHub repositories, where you can take a look at the source.</p>

<p>If you're looking to get in touch, you can e-mail me at <a href=\"mailto: JohnHinerIII@protonmail.com\">JohnHinerIII@protonmail.com</a> or find me through various means listed in the Contact section.</p>
