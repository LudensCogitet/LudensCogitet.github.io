				<h3>Robots!</h3>
				<img style="float: right;" src="../media/robots.png">
				Written in Java using the <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/" target="_blank">libGDX framework</a>, Robots! is my first commercially released game project.</p>
				<p>  It began as an attempt to rewrite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_(video_game)" target="_blank">this game</a> in order to learn. Eventually, after much tinkering, it became a haphazard attempt to “fix” what I saw as the inherently flawed design of the versions of that game that had come before.</p>
				<p>I think I succeeded fairly well in maintaining what makes the game interesting while removing the major flaw: the rapid devolution into random chance or inevitable defeat.</p>
				<p>I did no kind of marketing for this game, nor did I see a clear path to marketing an Android game with an intentionally bare bones 80’s arcade aesthetic and no modern bells and whistles. While I <em>am</em> pleased with it, especially as a first project, I really finished and released it so I could have something finished and released.</p>
				<p>You can check out the demo <a href="https://ludenscogitet.itch.io/robots-trial-version" target="_blank">here</a>, or buy the full version for a dollar <a href="https://ludenscogitet.itch.io/robots]" target="_blank">there</a>.</p>
