				<p>Hello. My name is John Hiner. I’m a husband, a father of four, a computer programmer, and an amature computer game developer. I don’t use the word amature in a derogatory sense. I use it for two other reasons: first, to indicate that I don’t have a whole lot of experience at it and, second, because I really do it for love as opposed to fame, or money, or whatever else.</p>
				<p>This doesn’t mean I don’t want to be famous or make money with my games. I’d very much like to be famous and rich because of my games at some point. The sooner the better really. But, I’ll have to make a few more and they’ll have to be better first. Also, I won’t change what I make or how I make it so I can <em>get</em> famous, or get money, or whatever else.</p>
				<p>The purpose of this weblog is to communicate what I’ve been working on and possibly what I’ve been thinking about in the realm of computer games. I’ve wanted to start something like this for a while, but only recently did I ask myself why. Why not just quietly make games and think about games for love and forsake the world? The simple answer, which is at least part of the truth, is that I’d like to get in on the conversation.</p>
				<p>There are some very good ideas about games floating around, and some very bad ones too. Hopefully I can add more good ones than bad ones and maybe someone else will benefit along the way.</p>
