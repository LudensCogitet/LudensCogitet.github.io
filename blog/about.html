				<p>Hello. My name is John Hiner. I’m a husband, a father of four, a computer programmer, and an amature computer game developer. Which is to say I don’t have a whole lot of experience at it and I really do it for love as opposed to fame, or money, or whatever else.</p>
				<p>The purpose of this weblog is to communicate what I’ve been working on and possibly what I’ve been thinking about in the realm of computer games. Why? Like I said, I love computer games. I want to be in on the conversation about them. I want to make games worth playing, and I want people to play them.</p>
				<p>There are some very good ideas about games floating around, and some very bad ones too. Hopefully I can add more good ones than bad ones and maybe someone else will benefit along the way.</p>
