				<h3>Game Bones: Overview</h3>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/LudensCogitet/GameBones" target="_blank">Game Bones</a> is not a game engine I’m writing in C, using <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL2</a> for input, graphics, sound, etc. Just looking at it, you’d be forgiven for calling it a clumsy attempt at a game engine, but it’s not I tell you!</p>

				<p>It’s not meant to be a comprehensive set of generic tools for making games. It’s not even meant to be used by anyone else ever. What it’s intended to be is a set of solutions to basic problems in game development that can be reused and refitted to different projects. It’s meant to be hacked apart and put back together.</p>

				<p>The original goal was to write a set of tools that would allow me to use C and write all my own game code while putting me on an equal footing with people using <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> or <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> for something like a game jam.</p>

				<p>That goal is still a good touchstone, but things have evolved. You see, I also started learning Unity, thinking that if I ever wanted to work with other people I should probably be familiar with the kind of tools we’d be likely to use together.</p>

				<p>And then I thought, why not implement the same game mechanics using Unity and Game Bones at the same time, trying to keep two versions of the same project as parallel as possible? There are any number of reasons why not, but I'm doing it. Reasons <i>to</i> do it include: learning more about Unity as I experiment while also developing things using my own tools.</p>

				<p>I expect it to be quicker to implement things in Unity, at least at first, and that my own C code will execute faster and be smaller. Whether I can keep this up, implement the features I want in the C project, and keep the implementations close enough remains to be seen. It’s an adventure.</p>
